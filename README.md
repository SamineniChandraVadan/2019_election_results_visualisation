## Insights from the Visualization
* Here are some of the insights we can get by comparing visual representation of 2014 and 2019 election results
* Congress lost its foot hold in North eastern states whereas BJP became strong in those areas
* Congress is able to withhold it's strength in Punjab
* Although congress lost seats in many northern parts of the country it shows positive signs in southern states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala
* In Tamil Nadu, AIDMK is wiped of the map ( The reason can be attributed to death of Smt.Jayalalitha and series of events post her demise)
* In Andhra Pradesh, TDP is almost wiped off
* By comparing the results in 2014 and 2019 in south eastern regions of the country, we can see that BJP is becoming strong in these regions. It has entered in to the states Telangana, Orissa  and West Bengal 
* BJP is able to withhold power in most of the constituencies it has won in 2014, this is a strong sign of strength and stability 
* BJP entered into many southern states and expect it to become more powerful in the forthcoming years
* The trend shows many regional parties are loosing their hold in their regions and National parties are becoming more stronger
* One thing is very clear Modi and Amit shah combo is very effective in strengthening BJP, for any government to function at its best there should be a strong opposition that brings the downside of each move into the argument.
